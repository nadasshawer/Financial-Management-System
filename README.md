#Finance-Tracker

Skills: 💻 C++ · 🧩 OOP Design · 📂 File Handling · 🔍 Encryption

I developed a personal finance management system in C++ to help users track income, expenses, and savings efficiently. The application features a secure login system, transaction logging, budget tracking, and automated financial reports. Using OOP principles and file handling, I ensured data persistence and a scalable architecture. This project strengthened my C++ programming, system design, and problem-solving skills while delivering a practical tool for financial literacy.
